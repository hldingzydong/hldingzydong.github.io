### [Basic Concept](https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2019/slides/01-introduction.pdf)
- A **data model** is collection of concepts for describing the data in a database.
- A **schema** is a description of a particular collection of data, using a given data model.
- A **relation** is unordered set that contain the relationship of attributes that represent entities.
- A **tuple** is a set of attribute values (also known as its domain) in the relation.
	- Values are (normally) atomic/scalar.
	- The special value NULL is a member of every domain.
- A relation’s **primary key** uniquely identifies a single tuple.
- A **foreign key** specifies that an attribute from one relation has to map to a tuple in another relation.  



### Relation Algebra
> Fundamental operations to retrieve and manipulate tuples in a relation. Each operator takes one or more relations as its inputs and outputs a new relation.
